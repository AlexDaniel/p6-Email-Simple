This is my attempt at porting Email::Simple from perl 5 to perl 6 (mostly just because I can)

It will currently parse some simple emails, at least, although there are unimplemented functions.

DIFFERENCES FROM PERL 5'S EMAIL::SIMPLE
---------------------------------------
I've tried to keep the api the same, with one exception:
$mail.header-pairs now returns an array of arrays instead of a flat array.

TODO
----
* write more tests
* write (more) documentation/comments
* Allow for user to specify their own header class
